## A Machine Learning project based on prediciting students grades/performance in Mathematics

- This project makes use of a dataset provided by the [UC Irvine Machine learning Reprository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)

The aim of this repo is to help me understand the Linear Regression Model and how it works using sklearn

#### The parameters involved are:
- The number of times the student was absent in class
- The number of times the student failed
- The amount of hours put in studying
- The student grade 1 score (G1)
- The Student grade 2 score (G2)
- The Student grade 3 score (G3)
